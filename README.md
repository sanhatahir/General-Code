### Introduction:

Like this hatchling breaking free of its egg, I am an aspiring data scientist, only just breaking out of my shell! 

I finished my Bachelors way back in the olden days of 2020, with a joint degree in Economics and Matheamtics, with three years' worth of Dean's Honor List awards and a final accolade of a Valedictorian. 

I worked for a few years, before deciding to dive back into academics. 

Currently, I am pursuing a Masters in Data Science and Public Policy at McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University in Washington, DC. 

I'm currently in search of summer internship opportunities where I can hone my data science skills, particularly in machine learning.
